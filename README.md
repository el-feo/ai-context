# AI Context

> **Project Status**: ðŸš§ Under Development ðŸš§

## Overview

AI Context is a collection of tools, prompts, and rules designed to enhance developer productivity when working with Large Language Models (LLMs) in their preferred code editors. This project aims to standardize the interaction between developers and AI assistants, making it easier to leverage AI capabilities regardless of the editor environment.

## Why AI Context?

Working with LLMs can significantly boost development speed, but inconsistent interaction patterns across different platforms can create friction. AI Context provides:

- **Standardized Prompts**: Optimized prompts that work across multiple LLM platforms
- **Editor Integration**: Guidelines for seamless integration with popular code editors
- **Best Practices**: Rules and patterns for effective AI collaboration

## Features

- âœ… **Cross-Editor Compatibility**: Use the same prompts and workflows in VSCode, JetBrains IDEs, Vim, Emacs, and more
- â¬œ **Task-Specific Templates**: Pre-configured prompts for common development tasks like code review, refactoring, and documentation
- â¬œ **Customization Framework**: Adapt the prompts and rules to your specific needs and workflows
- â¬œ **Community-Driven**: Benefit from and contribute to a growing collection of proven AI interaction patterns
