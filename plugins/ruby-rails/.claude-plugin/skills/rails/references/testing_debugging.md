# Chapters

This guide explores how to write tests in Rails.

After reading this guide, you will know:

- Rails testing terminology.

- How to write unit, functional, integration, and system tests for your
application.

- Other popular testing approaches and plugins.

## 1. Why Write Tests?

Writing automated tests can be a faster way of ensuring your code continues to
work as expected than manual testing through the browser or the console. Failing
tests can quickly reveal issues, allowing you to identify and fix bugs early in
the development process. This practice not only improves the reliability of your
code but also improves confidence in your changes.

Rails makes it easy to write tests. You can read more about Rails' built in
support for testing in the next section.

## 2. Introduction to Testing

With Rails, testing is central to the development process right from the
creation of a new application.

### 2.1. Test Setup

Rails creates a test directory for you as soon as you create a Rails project
using bin/rails new application_name. If you list the contents of this directory
then you will see:

```bash
$ ls -F test
controllers/                     helpers/                         mailers/                         fixtures/                        integration/                     models/                          test_helper.rb
```

### 2.2. Test Directories

The helpers, mailers, and models directories store tests for view
helpers, mailers, and
models, respectively.

The controllers directory is used for
tests related to controllers, routes, and
views, where HTTP requests will be simulated and assertions made on the
outcomes.

The integration directory is reserved for tests that cover
interactions between controllers.

The system test directory holds system tests, which are
used for full browser testing of your application. System tests allow you to
test your application the way your users experience it and help you test your
JavaScript as well. System tests inherit from
Capybara and perform in-browser
tests for your application.

Fixtures
are a way of mocking up data to use in your tests, so that you don't have to use
'real' data. They are stored in the fixtures directory, and you can read more
about them in the Fixtures section below.

A jobs directory will also be created for your job tests when you first
generate a job.

The test_helper.rb file holds the default configuration for your tests.

The application_system_test_case.rb holds the default configuration for your
system tests.

### 2.3. The Test Environment

By default, every Rails application has three environments: development, test,
and production.

Each environment's configuration can be modified similarly. In this case, we can
modify our test environment by changing the options found in
config/environments/test.rb.

Your tests are run under RAILS_ENV=test. This is set by Rails automatically.

### 2.4. Writing Your First Test

We introduced the bin/rails generate model command in the Getting Started
with Rails guide.
Alongside creating a model, this command also creates a test stub in the test
directory:

```bash
$ bin/rails generate model article title:string body:text
...
create  app/models/article.rb
create  test/models/article_test.rb
...
```

The default test stub in test/models/article_test.rb looks like this:

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class ArticleTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  # test "the truth" do
  #   assert true
  # end
end
```

A line by line examination of this file will help get you oriented to Rails
testing code and terminology.

```ruby
require "test_helper"
```

Requiring the file, test_helper.rb, loads the default configuration to run
tests. All methods added to this file are also available in tests when this file
is included.

```ruby
class ArticleTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  # ...
end
```

This is called a test case, because the ArticleTest class inherits from
ActiveSupport::TestCase. It therefore also has all the methods from
ActiveSupport::TestCase available to it. Later in this
guide, we'll see some of the methods this gives us.

Any method defined within a class inherited from Minitest::Test (which is the
superclass of ActiveSupport::TestCase) that begins with test_is simply
called a test. So, methods defined as test_password and test_valid_password
are test names and are run automatically when the test case is run.

Rails also adds a test method that takes a test name and a block. It generates
a standard Minitest::Unit test with method names prefixed with test_,
allowing you to focus on writing the test logic without having to think about
naming the methods. For example, you can write:

```ruby
test "the truth" do
  assert true
end
```

Which is approximately the same as writing this:

```ruby
def test_the_truth
  assert true
end
```

Although you can still use regular method definitions, using the test macro
allows for a more readable test name.

The method name is generated by replacing spaces with underscores. The
result does not need to be a valid Ruby identifier, as Ruby allows any string to
serve as a method name, including those containing punctuation characters. While
this may require using define_method and send to define and invoke such
methods, there are few formal restrictions on the names themselves.

This part of a test is called an 'assertion':

```ruby
assert true
```

An assertion is a line of code that evaluates an object (or expression) for
expected results. For example, an assertion can check:

- does this value equal that value?

- is this object nil?

- does this line of code throw an exception?

- is the user's password greater than 5 characters?

Every test may contain one or more assertions, with no restriction as to how
many assertions are allowed. Only when all the assertions are successful will
the test pass.

#### 2.4.1. Your First Failing Test

To see how a test failure is reported, you can add a failing test to the
article_test.rb test case. In this example, it is asserted that the article
will not save without meeting certain criteria; hence, if the article saves
successfully, the test will fail, demonstrating a test failure.

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class ArticleTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  test "should not save article without title" do
    article = Article.new
    assert_not article.save
  end
end
```

Here is the output if this newly added test is run:

```bash
$ bin/rails test test/models/article_test.rb
Running 1 tests in a single process (parallelization threshold is 50)
Run options: --seed 44656

# Running:

F

Failure:
ArticleTest#test_should_not_save_article_without_title [/path/to/blog/test/models/article_test.rb:4]:
Expected true to be nil or false


bin/rails test test/models/article_test.rb:4



Finished in 0.023918s, 41.8090 runs/s, 41.8090 assertions/s.

1 runs, 1 assertions, 1 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

In the output, F indicates a test failure. The section under Failure
includes the name of the failing test, followed by a stack trace and a message
showing the actual value and the expected value from the assertion. The default
assertion messages offer just enough information to help identify the error. For
improved readability, every assertion allows an optional message parameter to
customize the failure message, as shown below:

```ruby
test "should not save article without title" do
  article = Article.new
  assert_not article.save, "Saved the article without a title"
end
```

Running this test shows the friendlier assertion message:

```
Failure:
ArticleTest#test_should_not_save_article_without_title [/path/to/blog/test/models/article_test.rb:6]:
Saved the article without a title
```

To get this test to pass a model-level validation can be added for the title
field.

```ruby
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  validates :title, presence: true
end
```

Now the test should pass, as the article in our test has not been initialized
with a title, so the model validation will prevent the save. This can be
verified by running the test again:

```bash
$ bin/rails test test/models/article_test.rb:6
Running 1 tests in a single process (parallelization threshold is 50)
Run options: --seed 31252

# Running:

.

Finished in 0.027476s, 36.3952 runs/s, 36.3952 assertions/s.

1 runs, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

The small green dot displayed means that the test has passed successfully.

In the process above, a test was written first which fails for a desired
functionality, then after, some code was written which adds the functionality.
Finally, the test was run again to ensure it passes. This approach to software
development is referred to as Test-Driven Development (TDD).

#### 2.4.2. Reporting Errors

To see how an error gets reported, here's a test containing an error:

```ruby
test "should report error" do
  # some_undefined_variable is not defined elsewhere in the test case
  some_undefined_variable
  assert true
end
```

Now you can see even more output in the console from running the tests:

```bash
$ bin/rails test test/models/article_test.rb
Running 2 tests in a single process (parallelization threshold is 50)
Run options: --seed 1808

# Running:

E

Error:
ArticleTest#test_should_report_error:
NameError: undefined local variable or method 'some_undefined_variable' for #<ArticleTest:0x007fee3aa71798>
    test/models/article_test.rb:11:in 'block in <class:ArticleTest>'


bin/rails test test/models/article_test.rb:9

.

Finished in 0.040609s, 49.2500 runs/s, 24.6250 assertions/s.

2 runs, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 1 errors, 0 skips
```

Notice the 'E' in the output. It denotes a test with an error. The green dot
above the 'Finished' line denotes the one passing test.

The execution of each test method stops as soon as any error or an
assertion failure is encountered, and the test suite continues with the next
method. All test methods are executed in random order. The
config.active_support.test_order option can be used to configure test
order.

When a test fails you are presented with the corresponding backtrace. By
default, Rails filters the backtrace and will only print lines relevant to your
application. This eliminates noise and helps you to focus on your code. However,
in situations when you want to see the full backtrace, set the -b (or
--backtrace) argument to enable this behavior:

```bash
bin/rails test -b test/models/article_test.rb
```

If you want this test to pass you can modify it to use assert_raises (so you
are now checking for the presence of the error) like so:

```ruby
test "should report error" do
  # some_undefined_variable is not defined elsewhere in the test case
  assert_raises(NameError) do
    some_undefined_variable
  end
end
```

This test should now pass.

### 2.5. Minitest Assertions

By now you've caught a glimpse of some of the assertions that are available.
Assertions are the foundation blocks of testing. They are the ones that actually
perform the checks to ensure that things are going as planned.

Here's an extract of the assertions you can use with
minitest, the default testing library
used by Rails. The [msg] parameter is an optional string message you can
specify to make your test failure messages clearer.

The above are a subset of assertions that minitest supports. For an exhaustive
and more up-to-date list, please check the minitest API
documentation, specifically
Minitest::Assertions.

With minitest you can add your own assertions. In fact, that's exactly what
Rails does. It includes some specialized assertions to make your life easier.

Creating your own assertions is a topic that we won't cover in depth in
this guide.

### 2.6. Rails-Specific Assertions

Rails adds some custom assertions of its own to the minitest framework:

You'll see the usage of some of these assertions in the next chapter.

### 2.7. Assertions in Test Cases

All the basic assertions such as assert_equal defined in
Minitest::Assertions are also available in the classes we use in our own test
cases. In fact, Rails provides the following classes for you to inherit from:

- ActiveSupport::TestCase

- ActionMailer::TestCase

- ActionView::TestCase

- ActiveJob::TestCase

- ActionDispatch::Integration::Session

- ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase

- Rails::Generators::TestCase

Each of these classes include Minitest::Assertions, allowing us to use all of
the basic assertions in your tests.

For more information on minitest, refer to the minitest
documentation.

### 2.8. The Rails Test Runner

We can run all of our tests at once by using the bin/rails test command.

Or we can run a single test file by appending the filename to the bin/rails
test command.

```bash
$ bin/rails test test/models/article_test.rb
Running 1 tests in a single process (parallelization threshold is 50)
Run options: --seed 1559

# Running:

..

Finished in 0.027034s, 73.9810 runs/s, 110.9715 assertions/s.

2 runs, 3 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

This will run all test methods from the test case.

You can also run a particular test method from the test case by providing the
-n or --name flag and the test's method name.

```bash
$ bin/rails test test/models/article_test.rb -n test_the_truth
Running 1 tests in a single process (parallelization threshold is 50)
Run options: -n test_the_truth --seed 43583

# Running:

.

Finished tests in 0.009064s, 110.3266 tests/s, 110.3266 assertions/s.

1 tests, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

You can also run a test at a specific line by providing the line number.

```bash
bin/rails test test/models/article_test.rb:6 # run specific test and line
```

You can also run a range of tests by providing the line range.

```bash
bin/rails test test/models/article_test.rb:6-20 # runs tests from line 6 to 20
```

You can also run an entire directory of tests by providing the path to the
directory.

```bash
bin/rails test test/controllers # run all tests from specific directory
```

The test runner also provides a lot of other features like failing fast, showing
verbose progress, and so on. Check the documentation of the test runner using
the command below:

```bash
$ bin/rails test -h
Usage:
  bin/rails test [PATHS...]

Run tests except system tests

Examples:
    You can run a single test by appending a line number to a filename:

        bin/rails test test/models/user_test.rb:27

    You can run multiple tests with in a line range by appending the line range to a filename:

        bin/rails test test/models/user_test.rb:10-20

    You can run multiple files and directories at the same time:

        bin/rails test test/controllers test/integration/login_test.rb

    By default test failures and errors are reported inline during a run.

minitest options:
    -h, --help                       Display this help.
        --no-plugins                 Bypass minitest plugin auto-loading (or set $MT_NO_PLUGINS).
    -s, --seed SEED                  Sets random seed. Also via env. Eg: SEED=n rake
    -v, --verbose                    Verbose. Show progress processing files.
        --show-skips                 Show skipped at the end of run.
    -n, --name PATTERN               Filter run on /regexp/ or string.
        --exclude PATTERN            Exclude /regexp/ or string from run.
    -S, --skip CODES                 Skip reporting of certain types of results (eg E).

Known extensions: rails, pride
    -w, --warnings                   Run with Ruby warnings enabled
    -e, --environment ENV            Run tests in the ENV environment
    -b, --backtrace                  Show the complete backtrace
    -d, --defer-output               Output test failures and errors after the test run
    -f, --fail-fast                  Abort test run on first failure or error
    -c, --[no-]color                 Enable color in the output
        --profile [COUNT]            Enable profiling of tests and list the slowest test cases (default: 10)
    -p, --pride                      Pride. Show your testing pride!
```

## 3. The Test Database

Just about every Rails application interacts heavily with a database and so your
tests will need a database to interact with as well. This section covers how to
set up this test database and populate it with sample data.

As mentioned in the Test Environment section, every
Rails application has three environments: development, test, and production. The
database for each one of them is configured in config/database.yml.

A dedicated test database allows you to set up and interact with test data in
isolation. This way your tests can interact with test data with confidence,
without worrying about the data in the development or production databases.

### 3.1. Maintaining the Test Database Schema

In order to run your tests, your test database needs the current schema. The
test helper checks whether your test database has any pending migrations. It
will try to load your db/schema.rb or db/structure.sql into the test
database. If migrations are still pending, an error will be raised. Usually this
indicates that your schema is not fully migrated. Running the migrations (using
bin/rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test) will bring the schema up to date.

If there were modifications to existing migrations, the test database
needs to be rebuilt. This can be done by executing bin/rails test:db.

### 3.2. Fixtures

For good tests, you'll need to give some thought to setting up test data. In
Rails, you can handle this by defining and customizing fixtures. You can find
comprehensive documentation in the Fixtures API
documentation.

#### 3.2.1. What are Fixtures?

Fixtures is a fancy word for a consistent set of test data. Fixtures allow you to populate your
testing database with predefined data before your tests run. Fixtures are
database independent and written in YAML. There is one file per model.

Fixtures are not designed to create every object that your tests need, and
are best managed when only used for default data that can be applied to the
common case.

Fixtures are stored in your test/fixtures directory.

#### 3.2.2. YAML

YAML is a human-readable data serialization language.
YAML-formatted fixtures are a human-friendly way to describe your sample data.
These types of fixtures have the .yml file extension (as in users.yml).

Here's a sample YAML fixture file:

```yaml
# lo & behold! I am a YAML comment!
david:
  name: David Heinemeier Hansson
  birthday: 1979-10-15
  profession: Systems development

steve:
  name: Steve Ross Kellock
  birthday: 1974-09-27
  profession: guy with keyboard
```

Each fixture is given a name followed by an indented list of colon-separated
key/value pairs. Records are typically separated by a blank line. You can place
comments in a fixture file by using the # character in the first column.

If you are working with associations, you can define
a reference node between two different fixtures. Here's an example with a
belongs_to/has_many association:

```yaml
# test/fixtures/categories.yml
web_frameworks:
  name: Web Frameworks
```

```yaml
# test/fixtures/articles.yml
first:
  title: Welcome to Rails!
  category: web_frameworks
```

```yaml
# test/fixtures/action_text/rich_texts.yml
first_content:
  record: first (Article)
  name: content
  body: <div>Hello, from <strong>a fixture</strong></div>
```

Notice the category key of the first Article found in
fixtures/articles.yml has a value of web_frameworks, and that the record key of the
first_content entry found in fixtures/action_text/rich_texts.yml has a value
of first (Article). This hints to Active Record to load the Category web_frameworks
found in fixtures/categories.yml for the former, and Action Text to load the
Article first found in fixtures/articles.yml for the latter.

For associations to reference one another by name, you can use the fixture
name instead of specifying the id: attribute on the associated fixtures. Rails
will auto-assign a primary key to be consistent between runs. For more
information on this association behavior please read the Fixtures API
documentation.

#### 3.2.3. File Attachment Fixtures

Like other Active Record-backed models, Active Storage attachment records
inherit from ActiveRecord::Base instances and can therefore be populated by
fixtures.

Consider an Article model that has an associated image as a thumbnail
attachment, along with fixture data YAML:

```ruby
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  has_one_attached :thumbnail
end
```

```yaml
# test/fixtures/articles.yml
first:
  title: An Article
```

Assuming that there is an image/png encoded file at
test/fixtures/files/first.png, the following YAML fixture entries will
generate the related ActiveStorage::Blob and ActiveStorage::Attachment
records:

```yaml
# test/fixtures/active_storage/blobs.yml
first_thumbnail_blob: <%= ActiveStorage::FixtureSet.blob filename: "first.png" %>
```

```yaml
# test/fixtures/active_storage/attachments.yml
first_thumbnail_attachment:
  name: thumbnail
  record: first (Article)
  blob: first_thumbnail_blob
```

#### 3.2.4. Embedding Code in Fixtures

ERB allows you to embed Ruby code within templates. The YAML fixture format is
pre-processed with ERB when Rails loads fixtures. This allows you to use Ruby to
help you generate some sample data. For example, the following code generates a
thousand users:

```ruby
<% 1000.times do |n| %>
  user_<%= n %>:
    username: <%= "user#{n}" %>
    email: <%= "user#{n}@example.com" %>
<% end %>
```

#### 3.2.5. Fixtures in Action

Rails automatically loads all fixtures from the test/fixtures directory by
default. Loading involves three steps:

- Remove any existing data from the table corresponding to the fixture

- Load the fixture data into the table

- Dump the fixture data into a method in case you want to access it directly

In order to remove existing data from the database, Rails tries to disable
referential integrity triggers (like foreign keys and check constraints). If you
are getting permission errors on running tests, make sure the database user has
the permission to disable these triggers in the testing environment. (In
PostgreSQL, only superusers can disable all triggers. Read more about
permissions in the PostgreSQL
docs).

#### 3.2.6. Fixtures are Active Record Objects

Fixtures are instances of Active Record. As mentioned above, you can access the
object directly because it is automatically available as a method whose scope is
local to the test case. For example:

```ruby
# this will return the User object for the fixture named david
users(:david)

# this will return the property for david called id
users(:david).id

# methods available to the User object can also be accessed
david = users(:david)
david.call(david.partner)
```

To get multiple fixtures at once, you can pass in a list of fixture names. For
example:

```ruby
# this will return an array containing the fixtures david and steve
users(:david, :steve)
```

### 3.3. Transactions

By default, Rails automatically wraps tests in a database transaction that is
rolled back once completed. This makes tests independent of each other and means
that changes to the database are only visible within a single test.

```ruby
class MyTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  test "newly created users are active by default" do
    # Since the test is implicitly wrapped in a database transaction, the user
    # created here won't be seen by other tests.
    assert User.create.active?
  end
end
```

The method
ActiveRecord::Base.current_transaction
still acts as intended, though:

```ruby
class MyTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  test "Active Record current_transaction method works as expected" do
    # The implicit transaction around tests does not interfere with the
    # application-level semantics of the current_transaction.
    assert User.current_transaction.blank?
  end
end
```

If there are multiple writing databases
in place, tests are wrapped in as many respective transactions, and all of them
are rolled back.

#### 3.3.1. Opting-out of Test Transactions

Individual test cases can opt-out:

```ruby
class MyTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  # No implicit database transaction wraps the tests in this test case.
  self.use_transactional_tests = false
end
```

## 4. Testing Models

Model tests are used to test the models of your application and their associated
logic. You can test this logic using the assertions and fixtures that we've
explored in the sections above.

Rails model tests are stored under the test/models directory. Rails provides a
generator to create a model test skeleton for you.

```bash
$ bin/rails generate test_unit:model article
create  test/models/article_test.rb
```

This command will generate the following file:

```ruby
# article_test.rb
require "test_helper"

class ArticleTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  # test "the truth" do
  #   assert true
  # end
end
```

Model tests don't have their own superclass like ActionMailer::TestCase.
Instead, they inherit from
ActiveSupport::TestCase.

## 5. Functional Testing for Controllers

When writing functional tests, you are focusing on testing how controller
actions handle the requests and the expected result or response. Functional
controller tests are used to test controllers and other behavior, like API responses.

### 5.1. What to Include in Your Functional Tests

You could test for things such as:

- was the web request successful?

- was the user redirected to the right page?

- was the user successfully authenticated?

- was the correct information displayed in the response?

The easiest way to see functional tests in action is to generate a controller
using the scaffold generator:

```bash
$ bin/rails generate scaffold_controller article
...
create  app/controllers/articles_controller.rb
...
invoke  test_unit
create    test/controllers/articles_controller_test.rb
...
```

This will generate the controller code and tests for an Article resource. You
can take a look at the file articles_controller_test.rb in the
test/controllers directory.

If you already have a controller and just want to generate the test scaffold
code for each of the seven default actions, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ bin/rails generate test_unit:scaffold article
...
invoke  test_unit
create    test/controllers/articles_controller_test.rb
...
```

if you are generating test scaffold code, you will see an @article value
is set and used throughout the test file. This instance of article uses the
attributes nested within a :one key in the test/fixtures/articles.yml file.
Make sure you have set the key and related values in this file before you try to
run the tests.

Let's take a look at one such test, test_should_get_index from the file
articles_controller_test.rb.

```ruby
# articles_controller_test.rb
class ArticlesControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  test "should get index" do
    get articles_url
    assert_response :success
  end
end
```

In the test_should_get_index test, Rails simulates a request on the action
called index, making sure the request was successful, and also ensuring that
the right response body has been generated.

The get method kicks off the web request and populates the results into the
@response. It can accept up to 6 arguments:

- The URI of the controller action you are requesting. This can be in the form
of a string or a route helper (e.g. articles_url).

- params: option with a hash of request parameters to pass into the action
(e.g. query string parameters or article variables).

- headers: for setting the headers that will be passed with the request.

- env: for customizing the request environment as needed.

- xhr: whether the request is AJAX request or not. Can be set to true for
marking the request as AJAX.

- as: for encoding the request with different content type.

All of these keyword arguments are optional.

Example: Calling the :show action (via a get request) for the first
Article, passing in an HTTP_REFERER header:

```ruby
get article_url(Article.first), headers: { "HTTP_REFERER" => "http://example.com/home" }
```

Another example: Calling the :update action (via a patch request) for the
last Article, passing in new text for the title in params, as an AJAX
request:

```ruby
patch article_url(Article.last), params: { article: { title: "updated" } }, xhr: true
```

One more example: Calling the :create action (via a post request) to create
a new article, passing in text for the title in params, as JSON request:

```ruby
post articles_url, params: { article: { title: "Ahoy!" } }, as: :json
```

If you try running the test_should_create_article test from
articles_controller_test.rb it will (correctly) fail due to the newly added
model-level validation.

Now to modify the test_should_create_article test in
articles_controller_test.rb so that this test passes:

```ruby
test "should create article" do
  assert_difference("Article.count") do
    post articles_url, params: { article: { body: "Rails is awesome!", title: "Hello Rails" } }
  end

  assert_redirected_to article_path(Article.last)
end
```

You can now run this test and it will pass.

If you followed the steps in the Basic
Authentication section, you'll need
to add authorization to every request header to get all the tests passing:

```ruby
post articles_url, params: { article: { body: "Rails is awesome!", title: "Hello Rails" } }, headers: { Authorization: ActionController::HttpAuthentication::Basic.encode_credentials("dhh", "secret") }
```

### 5.2. HTTP Request Types for Functional Tests

If you're familiar with the HTTP protocol, you'll know that get is a type of
request. There are 6 request types supported in Rails functional tests:

- get

- post

- patch

- put

- head

- delete

All of the request types have equivalent methods that you can use. In a typical
CRUD application you'll be using post, get, put, and delete most
often.

Functional tests do not verify whether the specified request type is
accepted by the action; instead, they focus on the result. For testing the
request type, request tests are available, making your tests more purposeful.

### 5.3. Testing XHR (AJAX) Requests

An AJAX request (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique where content is
fetched from the server using asynchronous HTTP requests and the relevant parts
of the page are updated without requiring a full page load.

To test AJAX requests, you can specify the xhr: true option to get, post,
patch, put, and delete methods. For example:

```ruby
test "AJAX request" do
  article = articles(:one)
  get article_url(article), xhr: true

  assert_equal "hello world", @response.body
  assert_equal "text/javascript", @response.media_type
end
```

### 5.4. Testing Other Request Objects

After any request has been made and processed, you will have 3 Hash objects
ready for use:

- cookies - Any cookies that are set

- flash - Any objects living in the flash

- session - Any object living in session variables

As is the case with normal Hash objects, you can access the values by
referencing the keys by string. You can also reference them by symbol name. For
example:

```ruby
flash["gordon"]               # or flash[:gordon]
session["shmession"]          # or session[:shmession]
cookies["are_good_for_u"]     # or cookies[:are_good_for_u]
```

### 5.5. Instance Variables

You also have access to three instance variables in your functional tests after
a request is made:

- @controller - The controller processing the request

- @request - The request object

- @response - The response object

```ruby
class ArticlesControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  test "should get index" do
    get articles_url

    assert_equal "index", @controller.action_name
    assert_equal "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", @request.media_type
    assert_match "Articles", @response.body
  end
end
```

### 5.6. Setting Headers and CGI Variables

HTTP headers are pieces of information sent along with HTTP requests to provide
important metadata. CGI variables are environment variables used to exchange
information between the web server and the application.

HTTP headers and CGI variables can be tested by being passed as headers:

```ruby
# setting an HTTP Header
get articles_url, headers: { "Content-Type": "text/plain" } # simulate the request with custom header

# setting a CGI variable
get articles_url, headers: { "HTTP_REFERER": "http://example.com/home" } # simulate the request with custom env variable
```

### 5.7. Testing flash Notices

As can be seen in the testing other request objects
section, one of the three hash objects that is
accessible in the tests is flash. This section outlines how to test the
appearance of a flash message in our blog application whenever someone
successfully creates a new article.

First, an assertion should be added to the test_should_create_article test:

```ruby
test "should create article" do
  assert_difference("Article.count") do
    post articles_url, params: { article: { title: "Some title" } }
  end

  assert_redirected_to article_path(Article.last)
  assert_equal "Article was successfully created.", flash[:notice]
end
```

If the test is run now, it should fail:

```bash
$ bin/rails test test/controllers/articles_controller_test.rb -n test_should_create_article
Running 1 tests in a single process (parallelization threshold is 50)
Run options: -n test_should_create_article --seed 32266

# Running:

F

Finished in 0.114870s, 8.7055 runs/s, 34.8220 assertions/s.

  1) Failure:
ArticlesControllerTest#test_should_create_article [/test/controllers/articles_controller_test.rb:16]:
--- expected
+++ actual
@@ -1 +1 @@
-"Article was successfully created."
+nil

1 runs, 4 assertions, 1 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

Now implement the flash message in the controller. The :create action should
look like this:

```ruby
def create
  @article = Article.new(article_params)

  if @article.save
    flash[:notice] = "Article was successfully created."
    redirect_to @article
  else
    render "new"
  end
end
```

Now, if the tests are run they should pass:

```bash
$ bin/rails test test/controllers/articles_controller_test.rb -n test_should_create_article
Running 1 tests in a single process (parallelization threshold is 50)
Run options: -n test_should_create_article --seed 18981

# Running:

.

Finished in 0.081972s, 12.1993 runs/s, 48.7972 assertions/s.

1 runs, 4 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

If you generated your controller using the scaffold generator, the flash
message will already be implemented in your create action.

### 5.8. Tests for show, update, and delete Actions

So far in the guide tests for the :index as well as the:create action have
been outlined. What about the other actions?

You can write a test for :show as follows:

```ruby
test "should show article" do
  article = articles(:one)
  get article_url(article)
  assert_response :success
end
```

If you remember from our discussion earlier on fixtures, the
articles() method will provide access to the articles fixtures.

How about deleting an existing article?

```ruby
test "should delete article" do
  article = articles(:one)
  assert_difference("Article.count", -1) do
    delete article_url(article)
  end

  assert_redirected_to articles_path
end
```

Here is a test for updating an existing article:

```ruby
test "should update article" do
  article = articles(:one)

  patch article_url(article), params: { article: { title: "updated" } }

  assert_redirected_to article_path(article)
  # Reload article to refresh data and assert that title is updated.
  article.reload
  assert_equal "updated", article.title
end
```

Notice that there is some duplication in these three tests - they both access
the same article fixture data. It is possible to DRY ('Don't Repeat
Yourself') the implementation by using the setup and teardown methods
provided by ActiveSupport::Callbacks.

The tests might look like this:

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class ArticlesControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  # called before every single test
  setup do
    @article = articles(:one)
  end

  # called after every single test
  teardown do
    # when controller is using cache it may be a good idea to reset it afterwards
    Rails.cache.clear
  end

  test "should show article" do
    # Reuse the @article instance variable from setup
    get article_url(@article)
    assert_response :success
  end

  test "should destroy article" do
    assert_difference("Article.count", -1) do
      delete article_url(@article)
    end

    assert_redirected_to articles_path
  end

  test "should update article" do
    patch article_url(@article), params: { article: { title: "updated" } }

    assert_redirected_to article_path(@article)
    # Reload association to fetch updated data and assert that title is updated.
    @article.reload
    assert_equal "updated", @article.title
  end
end
```

Similar to other callbacks in Rails, the setup and teardown methods
can also accept a block, lambda, or a method name as a symbol to be called.

## 6. Integration Testing

Integration tests take functional controller tests one step further - they focus
on testing how several parts of an application interact, and are generally used
to test important workflows. Rails integration tests are stored in the
test/integration directory.

Rails provides a generator to create an integration test skeleton as follows:

```bash
$ bin/rails generate integration_test user_flows
      invoke  test_unit
      create  test/integration/user_flows_test.rb
```

Here's what a freshly generated integration test looks like:

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class UserFlowsTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  # test "the truth" do
  #   assert true
  # end
end
```

Here the test is inheriting from
ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest.
This makes some additional helpers available for integration
tests alongside the
standard testing helpers.

### 6.1. Implementing an Integration Test

Let's add an integration test to our blog application, by starting with a basic
workflow of creating a new blog article to verify that everything is working
properly.

Start by generating the integration test skeleton:

```bash
bin/rails generate integration_test blog_flow
```

It should have created a test file placeholder. With the output of the previous
command you should see:

```
invoke  test_unit
      create    test/integration/blog_flow_test.rb
```

Now open that file and write the first assertion:

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class BlogFlowTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  test "can see the welcome page" do
    get "/"
    assert_dom "h1", "Welcome#index"
  end
end
```

If you visit the root path, you should see welcome/index.html.erb rendered for
the view. So this assertion should pass.

The assertion assert_dom (aliased to assert_select) is available in integration tests to check
the presence of key HTML elements and their content.

#### 6.1.1. Creating Articles Integration

To test the ability to create a new article in our blog and display the
resulting article, see the example below:

```ruby
test "can create an article" do
  get "/articles/new"
  assert_response :success

  post "/articles",
    params: { article: { title: "can create", body: "article successfully." } }
  assert_response :redirect
  follow_redirect!
  assert_response :success
  assert_dom "p", "Title:\n  can create"
end
```

The :new action of our Articles controller is called first, and the response
should be successful.

Next, a post request is made to the :create action of the Articles
controller:

```ruby
post "/articles",
  params: { article: { title: "can create", body: "article successfully." } }
assert_response :redirect
follow_redirect!
```

The two lines following the request are to handle the redirect setup when
creating a new article.

Don't forget to call follow_redirect! if you plan to make subsequent
requests after a redirect is made.

Finally it can be asserted that the response was successful and the
newly-created article is readable on the page.

A very small workflow for visiting our blog and creating a new article was
successfully tested above. To extend this, additional tests could be added for
features like adding comments, editing comments or removing articles.
Integration tests are a great place to experiment with all kinds of use cases
for our applications.

### 6.2. Helpers Available for Integration Tests

There are numerous helpers to choose from for use in integration tests. Some
include:

- ActionDispatch::Integration::Runner
for helpers relating to the integration test runner, including creating a new
session.

- ActionDispatch::Integration::RequestHelpers
for performing requests.

- ActionDispatch::TestProcess::FixtureFile
for uploading files.

- ActionDispatch::Integration::Session
to modify sessions or the state of the integration tests.

ActionDispatch::Integration::Runner
for helpers relating to the integration test runner, including creating a new
session.

ActionDispatch::Integration::RequestHelpers
for performing requests.

ActionDispatch::TestProcess::FixtureFile
for uploading files.

ActionDispatch::Integration::Session
to modify sessions or the state of the integration tests.

## 7. System Testing

Similarly to integration testing, system testing allows you to test how the
components of your app work together, but from the point of view of a user. It
does this by running tests in either a real or a headless browser (a browser
which runs in the background without opening a visible window). System tests use
Capybara under the hood.

### 7.1. When to Use System Tests

System tests provide the most realistic testing experience as they test your
application from a user's perspective. However, they come with important
trade-offs:

- They are significantly slower than unit and integration tests

- They can be brittle and prone to failures from timing issues or UI changes

- They require more maintenance as your UI evolves

Given these trade-offs, system tests should be reserved for critical user
paths rather than being created for every feature. Consider writing system
tests for:

- Core business workflows (e.g., user registration, checkout process,
payment flows)

- Critical user interactions that integrate multiple components

- Complex JavaScript interactions that can't be tested at lower levels

For most features, integration tests provide a better balance of coverage and
maintainability. Save system tests for scenarios where you need to verify the
complete user experience.

### 7.2. Generating System Tests

Rails no longer generates system tests by default when using scaffolds. This
change reflects the best practice of using system tests sparingly. You can
generate system tests in two ways:

- When scaffolding, explicitly enable system tests:

```bash
bin/rails generate scaffold Article title:string body:text --system-tests=true
```

- Generate system tests independently for critical features:

```bash
bin/rails generate system_test articles
```

Rails system tests are stored in the test/system directory in your
application. To generate a system test skeleton, run the following command:

```bash
$ bin/rails generate system_test users
      invoke test_unit
      create test/system/users_test.rb
```

Here's what a freshly generated system test looks like:

```ruby
require "application_system_test_case"

class UsersTest < ApplicationSystemTestCase
  # test "visiting the index" do
  #   visit users_url
  #
  #   assert_dom "h1", text: "Users"
  # end
end
```

By default, system tests are run with the Selenium driver, using the Chrome
browser, and a screen size of 1400x1400. The next section explains how to change
the default settings.

### 7.3. Changing the Default Settings

Rails makes changing the default settings for system tests very simple. All the
setup is abstracted away so you can focus on writing your tests.

When you generate a new application or scaffold, an
application_system_test_case.rb file is created in the test directory. This is
where all the configuration for your system tests should live.

If you want to change the default settings, you can change what the system tests
are "driven by". If you want to change the driver from Selenium to Cuprite,
you'd add the cuprite gem to your
Gemfile. Then in your application_system_test_case.rb file you'd do the
following:

```ruby
require "test_helper"
require "capybara/cuprite"

class ApplicationSystemTestCase < ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase
  driven_by :cuprite
end
```

The driver name is a required argument for driven_by. The optional arguments
that can be passed to driven_by are :using for the browser (this will only
be used by Selenium), :screen_size to change the size of the screen for
screenshots, and :options which can be used to set options supported by the
driver.

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class ApplicationSystemTestCase < ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase
  driven_by :selenium, using: :firefox
end
```

If you want to use a headless browser, you could use Headless Chrome or Headless
Firefox by adding headless_chrome or headless_firefox in the :using
argument.

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class ApplicationSystemTestCase < ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase
  driven_by :selenium, using: :headless_chrome
end
```

If you want to use a remote browser, e.g. Headless Chrome in
Docker, you have to add a remote
url and set browser as remote through options.

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class ApplicationSystemTestCase < ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase
  url = ENV.fetch("SELENIUM_REMOTE_URL", nil)
  options = if url
    { browser: :remote, url: url }
  else
    { browser: :chrome }
  end
  driven_by :selenium, using: :headless_chrome, options: options
end
```

Now you should get a connection to the remote browser.

```bash
SELENIUM_REMOTE_URL=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub bin/rails test:system
```

If your application is remote, e.g. within a Docker container, Capybara needs
more input about how to call remote
servers.

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class ApplicationSystemTestCase < ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase
  setup do
      Capybara.server_host = "0.0.0.0" # bind to all interfaces
      Capybara.app_host = "http://#{IPSocket.getaddress(Socket.gethostname)}" if ENV["SELENIUM_REMOTE_URL"].present?
    end
  # ...
end
```

Now you should get a connection to a remote browser and server, regardless if it
is running in a Docker container or CI.

If your Capybara configuration requires more setup than provided by Rails, this
additional configuration can be added into the application_system_test_case.rb
file.

Please see Capybara's
documentation for additional
settings.

### 7.4. Implementing a System Test

This section will demonstrate how to add a system test to your application,
which tests a visit to the index page to create a new blog article.

The scaffold generator no longer creates system tests by default. To
include system tests when scaffolding, use the --system-tests=true option.
Otherwise, create system tests manually for your critical user paths.

```bash
bin/rails generate system_test articles
```

It should have created a test file placeholder. With the output of the previous
command you should see:

```
invoke  test_unit
      create    test/system/articles_test.rb
```

Now, let's open that file and write the first assertion:

```ruby
require "application_system_test_case"

class ArticlesTest < ApplicationSystemTestCase
  test "viewing the index" do
    visit articles_path
    assert_selector "h1", text: "Articles"
  end
end
```

The test should see that there is an h1 on the articles index page and pass.

Run the system tests.

```bash
bin/rails test:system
```

By default, running bin/rails test won't run your system tests. Make
sure to run bin/rails test:system to actually run them. You can also run
bin/rails test:all to run all tests, including system tests.

#### 7.4.1. Creating Articles System Test

Now you can test the flow for creating a new article.

```ruby
test "should create Article" do
  visit articles_path

  click_on "New Article"

  fill_in "Title", with: "Creating an Article"
  fill_in "Body", with: "Created this article successfully!"

  click_on "Create Article"

  assert_text "Creating an Article"
end
```

The first step is to call visit articles_path. This will take the test to the
articles index page.

Then the click_on "New Article" will find the "New Article" button on the
index page. This will redirect the browser to /articles/new.

Then the test will fill in the title and body of the article with the specified
text. Once the fields are filled in, "Create Article" is clicked on which will
send a POST request to /articles/create.

This redirects the user back to the articles index page, and there it is
asserted that the text from the new article's title is on the articles index
page.

#### 7.4.2. Testing for Multiple Screen Sizes

If you want to test for mobile sizes in addition to testing for desktop, you can
create another class that inherits from ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase and use
it in your test suite. In this example, a file called
mobile_system_test_case.rb is created in the /test directory with the
following configuration.

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class MobileSystemTestCase < ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase
  driven_by :selenium, using: :chrome, screen_size: [375, 667]
end
```

To use this configuration, create a test inside test/system that inherits from
MobileSystemTestCase. Now you can test your app using multiple different
configurations.

```ruby
require "mobile_system_test_case"

class PostsTest < MobileSystemTestCase
  test "visiting the index" do
    visit posts_url
    assert_selector "h1", text: "Posts"
  end
end
```

#### 7.4.3. Capybara Assertions

Here's an extract of the assertions provided by
Capybara
which can be used in system tests.

#### 7.4.4. Screenshot Helper

The
ScreenshotHelper
is a helper designed to capture screenshots of your tests. This can be helpful
for viewing the browser at the point a test failed, or to view screenshots later
for debugging.

Two methods are provided: take_screenshot and take_failed_screenshot.
take_failed_screenshot is automatically included in before_teardown inside
Rails.

The take_screenshot helper method can be included anywhere in your tests to
take a screenshot of the browser.

#### 7.4.5. Taking It Further

System testing is similar to integration testing in that
it tests the user's interaction with your controller, model, and view, but
system testing tests your application as if a real user were using it. With
system tests, you can test anything that a user would do in your application
such as commenting, deleting articles, publishing draft articles, etc.

## 8. Test Helpers

To avoid code duplication, you can add your own test helpers. Here is an example
for signing in:

```ruby
# test/test_helper.rb

module SignInHelper
  def sign_in_as(user)
    post sign_in_url(email: user.email, password: user.password)
  end
end

class ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  include SignInHelper
end
```

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class ProfileControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  test "should show profile" do
    # helper is now reusable from any controller test case
    sign_in_as users(:david)

    get profile_url
    assert_response :success
  end
end
```

### 8.1. Using Separate Files

If you find your helpers are cluttering test_helper.rb, you can extract them
into separate files. A good place to store them is test/lib or
test/test_helpers.

```ruby
# test/test_helpers/multiple_assertions.rb
module MultipleAssertions
  def assert_multiple_of_forty_two(number)
    assert (number % 42 == 0), "expected #{number} to be a multiple of 42"
  end
end
```

These helpers can then be explicitly required and included as needed:

```ruby
require "test_helper"
require "test_helpers/multiple_assertions"

class NumberTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  include MultipleAssertions

  test "420 is a multiple of 42" do
    assert_multiple_of_forty_two 420
  end
end
```

They can also continue to be included directly into the relevant parent classes:

```ruby
# test/test_helper.rb
require "test_helpers/sign_in_helper"

class ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  include SignInHelper
end
```

### 8.2. Eagerly Requiring Helpers

You may find it convenient to eagerly require helpers in test_helper.rb so
your test files have implicit access to them. This can be accomplished using
globbing, as follows

```ruby
# test/test_helper.rb
Dir[Rails.root.join("test", "test_helpers", "**", "*.rb")].each { |file| require file }
```

This has the downside of increasing the boot-up time, as opposed to manually
requiring only the necessary files in your individual tests.

## 9. Testing Routes

Like everything else in your Rails application, you can test your routes. Route
tests are stored in test/controllers/ or are part of controller tests. If your
application has complex routes, Rails provides a number of useful helpers to
test them.

For more information on routing assertions available in Rails, see the API
documentation for
ActionDispatch::Assertions::RoutingAssertions.

## 10. Testing Views

Testing the response to your request by asserting the presence of key HTML
elements and their content is one way to test the views of your application.
Like route tests, view tests are stored in test/controllers/ or are part of
controller tests.

### 10.1. Querying the HTML

Methods like assert_dom and assert_dom_equal allow you to query HTML
elements of the response by using a simple yet powerful syntax.

assert_dom is an assertion that will return true if matching elements are
found. For example, you could verify that the page title is "Welcome to the
Rails Testing Guide" as follows:

```ruby
assert_dom "title", "Welcome to the Rails Testing Guide"
```

You can also use nested assert_dom blocks for deeper investigation.

In the following example, the inner assert_dom for li.menu_item runs within
the collection of elements selected by the outer block:

```ruby
assert_dom "ul.navigation" do
  assert_dom "li.menu_item"
end
```

A collection of selected elements may also be iterated through so that
assert_dom may be called separately for each element. For example, if the
response contains two ordered lists, each with four nested list elements then
the following tests will both pass.

```ruby
assert_dom "ol" do |elements|
  elements.each do |element|
    assert_dom element, "li", 4
  end
end

assert_dom "ol" do
  assert_dom "li", 8
end
```

The assert_dom_equal method compares two HTML strings to see if they are
equal:

```ruby
assert_dom_equal '<a href="http://www.further-reading.com">Read more</a>',
  link_to("Read more", "http://www.further-reading.com")
```

For more advanced usage, refer to the rails-dom-testing
documentation.

In order to integrate with rails-dom-testing, tests that inherit from
ActionView::TestCase declare a document_root_element method that returns the
rendered content as an instance of a
Nokogiri::XML::Node:

```ruby
test "renders a link to itself" do
  article = Article.create! title: "Hello, world"

  render "articles/article", article: article
  anchor = document_root_element.at("a")

  assert_equal article.name, anchor.text
  assert_equal article_url(article), anchor["href"]
end
```

If your application depends on Nokogiri >=
1.14.0 or
higher, and minitest >=
5.18.0,
document_root_element supports Ruby's Pattern
Matching:

```ruby
test "renders a link to itself" do
  article = Article.create! title: "Hello, world"

  render "articles/article", article: article
  anchor = document_root_element.at("a")
  url = article_url(article)

  assert_pattern do
    anchor => { content: "Hello, world", attributes: [{ name: "href", value: url }] }
  end
end
```

If you'd like to access the same Capybara-powered
Assertions
that your System Testing tests utilize, you can define a base
class that inherits from ActionView::TestCase and transforms the
document_root_element into a page method:

```ruby
# test/view_partial_test_case.rb

require "test_helper"
require "capybara/minitest"

class ViewPartialTestCase < ActionView::TestCase
  include Capybara::Minitest::Assertions

  def page
    Capybara.string(rendered)
  end
end

# test/views/article_partial_test.rb

require "view_partial_test_case"

class ArticlePartialTest < ViewPartialTestCase
  test "renders a link to itself" do
    article = Article.create! title: "Hello, world"

    render "articles/article", article: article

    assert_link article.title, href: article_url(article)
  end
end
```

More information about the assertions included by Capybara can be found in the
Capybara Assertions section.

### 10.2. Parsing View Content

Starting in Action View version 7.1, the rendered helper method returns an
object capable of parsing the view partial's rendered content.

To transform the String content returned by the rendered method into an
object, define a parser by calling
register_parser.
Calling register_parser :rss defines a rendered.rss helper method. For
example, to parse rendered RSS content into an object with rendered.rss,
register a call to RSS::Parser.parse:

```ruby
register_parser :rss, -> rendered { RSS::Parser.parse(rendered) }

test "renders RSS" do
  article = Article.create!(title: "Hello, world")

  render formats: :rss, partial: article

  assert_equal "Hello, world", rendered.rss.items.last.title
end
```

By default, ActionView::TestCase defines a parser for:

- :html - returns an instance of
Nokogiri::XML::Node

- :json - returns an instance of
ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess

```ruby
test "renders HTML" do
  article = Article.create!(title: "Hello, world")

  render partial: "articles/article", locals: { article: article }

  assert_pattern { rendered.html.at("main h1") => { content: "Hello, world" } }
end

test "renders JSON" do
  article = Article.create!(title: "Hello, world")

  render formats: :json, partial: "articles/article", locals: { article: article }

  assert_pattern { rendered.json => { title: "Hello, world" } }
end
```

### 10.3. Additional View-Based Assertions

There are more assertions that are primarily used in testing views:

Here's an example of using assert_dom_email:

```ruby
assert_dom_email do
  assert_dom "small", "Please click the 'Unsubscribe' link if you want to opt-out."
end
```

### 10.4. Testing View Partials

Partial templates - usually called
"partials" - can break the rendering process into more manageable chunks. With
partials, you can extract sections of code from your views to separate files and
reuse them in multiple places.

View tests provide an opportunity to test that partials render content the way
you expect. View partial tests can be stored in test/views/ and inherit from
ActionView::TestCase.

To render a partial, call render like you would in a template. The content is
available through the test-local rendered method:

```ruby
class ArticlePartialTest < ActionView::TestCase
  test "renders a link to itself" do
    article = Article.create! title: "Hello, world"

    render "articles/article", article: article

    assert_includes rendered, article.title
  end
end
```

Tests that inherit from ActionView::TestCase also have access to
assert_dom and the other additional view-based
assertions provided by
rails-dom-testing:

```ruby
test "renders a link to itself" do
  article = Article.create! title: "Hello, world"

  render "articles/article", article: article

  assert_dom "a[href=?]", article_url(article), text: article.title
end
```

### 10.5. Testing View Helpers

A helper is a module where you can define methods which are available in your
views.

In order to test helpers, all you need to do is check that the output of the
helper method matches what you'd expect. Tests related to the helpers are
located under the test/helpers directory.

Given we have the following helper:

```ruby
module UsersHelper
  def link_to_user(user)
    link_to "#{user.first_name} #{user.last_name}", user
  end
end
```

We can test the output of this method like this:

```ruby
class UsersHelperTest < ActionView::TestCase
  test "should return the user's full name" do
    user = users(:david)

    assert_dom_equal %{<a href="/user/#{user.id}">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>}, link_to_user(user)
  end
end
```

Moreover, since the test class extends from ActionView::TestCase, you have
access to Rails' helper methods such as link_to or pluralize.

## 11. Testing Mailers

Your mailer classes - like every other part of your Rails application - should
be tested to ensure that they are working as expected.

The goals of testing your mailer classes are to ensure that:

- emails are being processed (created and sent)

- the email content is correct (subject, sender, body, etc)

- the right emails are being sent at the right times

There are two aspects of testing your mailer, the unit tests and the functional
tests. In the unit tests, you run the mailer in isolation with tightly
controlled inputs and compare the output to a known value (a
fixture). In the functional tests you don't so much test the
details produced by the mailer; instead, you test that the controllers and
models are using the mailer in the right way. You test to prove that the right
email was sent at the right time.

### 11.1. Unit Testing

In order to test that your mailer is working as expected, you can use unit tests
to compare the actual results of the mailer with pre-written examples of what
should be produced.

#### 11.1.1. Mailer Fixtures

For the purposes of unit testing a mailer, fixtures are used to provide an
example of how the output should look. Because these are example emails, and
not Active Record data like the other fixtures, they are kept in their own
subdirectory apart from the other fixtures. The name of the directory within
test/fixtures directly corresponds to the name of the mailer. So, for a mailer
named UserMailer, the fixtures should reside in test/fixtures/user_mailer
directory.

If you generated your mailer, the generator does not create stub fixtures for
the mailers actions. You'll have to create those files yourself as described
above.

#### 11.1.2. The Basic Test Case

Here's a unit test to test a mailer named UserMailer whose action invite is
used to send an invitation to a friend:

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class UserMailerTest < ActionMailer::TestCase
  test "invite" do
    # Create the email and store it for further assertions
    email = UserMailer.create_invite("me@example.com",
                                     "friend@example.com", Time.now)

    # Send the email, then test that it got queued
    assert_emails 1 do
      email.deliver_now
    end

    # Test the body of the sent email contains what we expect it to
    assert_equal ["me@example.com"], email.from
    assert_equal ["friend@example.com"], email.to
    assert_equal "You have been invited by me@example.com", email.subject
    assert_equal read_fixture("invite").join, email.body.to_s
  end
end
```

In the test the email is created and the returned object is stored in the
email variable. The first assert checks it was sent, then, in the second batch
of assertions, the email contents are checked. The helper read_fixture is used
to read in the content from this file.

email.body.to_s is present when there's only one (HTML or text) part
present. If the mailer provides both, you can test your fixture against specific
parts with email.text_part.body.to_s or email.html_part.body.to_s.

Here's the content of the invite fixture:

```
Hi friend@example.com,

You have been invited.

Cheers!
```

#### 11.1.3. Configuring the Delivery Method for Test

The line ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :test in
config/environments/test.rb sets the delivery method to test mode so that the
email will not actually be delivered (useful to avoid spamming your users while
testing). Instead, the email will be appended to an array
(ActionMailer::Base.deliveries).

The ActionMailer::Base.deliveries array is only reset automatically in
ActionMailer::TestCase and ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest tests. If you
want to have a clean slate outside these test cases, you can reset it manually
with: ActionMailer::Base.deliveries.clear

#### 11.1.4. Testing Enqueued Emails

You can use the assert_enqueued_email_with assertion to confirm that the email
has been enqueued with all of the expected mailer method arguments and/or
parameterized mailer parameters. This allows you to match any emails that have
been enqueued with the deliver_later method.

As with the basic test case, we create the email and store the returned object
in the email variable. The following examples include variations of passing
arguments and/or parameters.

This example will assert that the email has been enqueued with the correct
arguments:

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class UserMailerTest < ActionMailer::TestCase
  test "invite" do
    # Create the email and store it for further assertions
    email = UserMailer.create_invite("me@example.com", "friend@example.com")

    # Test that the email got enqueued with the correct arguments
    assert_enqueued_email_with UserMailer, :create_invite, args: ["me@example.com", "friend@example.com"] do
      email.deliver_later
    end
  end
end
```

This example will assert that a mailer has been enqueued with the correct mailer
method named arguments by passing a hash of the arguments as args:

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class UserMailerTest < ActionMailer::TestCase
  test "invite" do
    # Create the email and store it for further assertions
    email = UserMailer.create_invite(from: "me@example.com", to: "friend@example.com")

    # Test that the email got enqueued with the correct named arguments
    assert_enqueued_email_with UserMailer, :create_invite,
    args: [{ from: "me@example.com", to: "friend@example.com" }] do
      email.deliver_later
    end
  end
end
```

This example will assert that a parameterized mailer has been enqueued with the
correct parameters and arguments. The mailer parameters are passed as params
and the mailer method arguments as args:

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class UserMailerTest < ActionMailer::TestCase
  test "invite" do
    # Create the email and store it for further assertions
    email = UserMailer.with(all: "good").create_invite("me@example.com", "friend@example.com")

    # Test that the email got enqueued with the correct mailer parameters and arguments
    assert_enqueued_email_with UserMailer, :create_invite,
    params: { all: "good" }, args: ["me@example.com", "friend@example.com"] do
      email.deliver_later
    end
  end
end
```

This example shows an alternative way to test that a parameterized mailer has
been enqueued with the correct parameters:

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class UserMailerTest < ActionMailer::TestCase
  test "invite" do
    # Create the email and store it for further assertions
    email = UserMailer.with(to: "friend@example.com").create_invite

    # Test that the email got enqueued with the correct mailer parameters
    assert_enqueued_email_with UserMailer.with(to: "friend@example.com"), :create_invite do
      email.deliver_later
    end
  end
end
```

### 11.2. Functional and System Testing

Unit testing allows us to test the attributes of the email while functional and
system testing allows us to test whether user interactions appropriately trigger
the email to be delivered. For example, you can check that the invite friend
operation is sending an email appropriately:

```ruby
# Integration Test
require "test_helper"

class UsersControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  test "invite friend" do
    # Asserts the difference in the ActionMailer::Base.deliveries
    assert_emails 1 do
      post invite_friend_url, params: { email: "friend@example.com" }
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
# System Test
require "test_helper"

class UsersTest < ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase
  driven_by :selenium, using: :headless_chrome

  test "inviting a friend" do
    visit invite_users_url
    fill_in "Email", with: "friend@example.com"
    assert_emails 1 do
      click_on "Invite"
    end
  end
end
```

The assert_emails method is not tied to a particular deliver method and
will work with emails delivered with either the deliver_now or deliver_later
method. If we explicitly want to assert that the email has been enqueued we can
use the assert_enqueued_email_with (examples
above) or assert_enqueued_emails methods. More
information can be found in the
documentation.

## 12. Testing Jobs

Jobs can be tested in isolation (focusing on the job's behavior) and in context
(focusing on the calling code's behavior).

### 12.1. Testing Jobs in Isolation

When you generate a job, an associated test file will also be generated in the
test/jobs directory.

Here is a test you could write for a billing job:

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class BillingJobTest < ActiveJob::TestCase
  test "account is charged" do
    perform_enqueued_jobs do
      BillingJob.perform_later(account, product)
    end
    assert account.reload.charged_for?(product)
  end
end
```

The default queue adapter for tests will not perform jobs until
perform_enqueued_jobs is called. Additionally, it will clear all jobs
before each test is run so that tests do not interfere with each other.

The test uses perform_enqueued_jobs and perform_later instead of
perform_now so that if retries are configured, retry failures are caught
by the test instead of being re-enqueued and ignored.

### 12.2. Testing Jobs in Context

It's good practice to test that jobs are correctly enqueued, for example, by a
controller action. The ActiveJob::TestHelper module provides several
methods that can help with this, such as assert_enqueued_with.

Here is an example that tests an account model method:

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class AccountTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  include ActiveJob::TestHelper

  test "#charge_for enqueues billing job" do
    assert_enqueued_with(job: BillingJob) do
      account.charge_for(product)
    end

    assert_not account.reload.charged_for?(product)

    perform_enqueued_jobs

    assert account.reload.charged_for?(product)
  end
end
```

### 12.3. Testing that Exceptions are Raised

Testing that your job raises an exception in certain cases can be tricky,
especially when you have retries configured. The perform_enqueued_jobs helper
fails any test where a job raises an exception, so to have the test succeed when
the exception is raised you have to call the job's perform method directly.

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class BillingJobTest < ActiveJob::TestCase
  test "does not charge accounts with insufficient funds" do
    assert_raises(InsufficientFundsError) do
      BillingJob.new(empty_account, product).perform
    end
    assert_not account.reload.charged_for?(product)
  end
end
```

This method is not recommended in general, as it circumvents some parts of the
framework, such as argument serialization.

## 13. Testing Action Cable

Since Action Cable is used at different levels inside your application, you'll
need to test both the channels, connection classes themselves, and that other
entities broadcast correct messages.

### 13.1. Connection Test Case

By default, when you generate a new Rails application with Action Cable, a test
for the base connection class (ApplicationCable::Connection) is generated as
well under test/channels/application_cable directory.

Connection tests aim to check whether a connection's identifiers get assigned
properly or that any improper connection requests are rejected. Here is an
example:

```ruby
class ApplicationCable::ConnectionTest < ActionCable::Connection::TestCase
  test "connects with params" do
    # Simulate a connection opening by calling the `connect` method
    connect params: { user_id: 42 }

    # You can access the Connection object via `connection` in tests
    assert_equal connection.user_id, "42"
  end

  test "rejects connection without params" do
    # Use `assert_reject_connection` matcher to verify that
    # connection is rejected
    assert_reject_connection { connect }
  end
end
```

You can also specify request cookies the same way you do in integration tests:

```ruby
test "connects with cookies" do
  cookies.signed[:user_id] = "42"

  connect

  assert_equal connection.user_id, "42"
end
```

See the API documentation for
ActionCable::Connection::TestCase
for more information.

### 13.2. Channel Test Case

By default, when you generate a channel, an associated test will be generated as
well under the test/channels directory. Here's an example test with a chat
channel:

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class ChatChannelTest < ActionCable::Channel::TestCase
  test "subscribes and stream for room" do
    # Simulate a subscription creation by calling `subscribe`
    subscribe room: "15"

    # You can access the Channel object via `subscription` in tests
    assert subscription.confirmed?
    assert_has_stream "chat_15"
  end
end
```

This test is pretty simple and only asserts that the channel subscribes the
connection to a particular stream.

You can also specify the underlying connection identifiers. Here's an example
test with a web notifications channel:

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class WebNotificationsChannelTest < ActionCable::Channel::TestCase
  test "subscribes and stream for user" do
    stub_connection current_user: users(:john)

    subscribe

    assert_has_stream_for users(:john)
  end
end
```

See the API documentation for
ActionCable::Channel::TestCase
for more information.

### 13.3. Custom Assertions And Testing Broadcasts Inside Other Components

Action Cable ships with a bunch of custom assertions that can be used to lessen
the verbosity of tests. For a full list of available assertions, see the API
documentation for
ActionCable::TestHelper.

It's a good practice to ensure that the correct message has been broadcasted
inside other components (e.g. inside your controllers). This is precisely where
the custom assertions provided by Action Cable are pretty useful. For instance,
within a model:

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class ProductTest < ActionCable::TestCase
  test "broadcast status after charge" do
    assert_broadcast_on("products:#{product.id}", type: "charged") do
      product.charge(account)
    end
  end
end
```

If you want to test the broadcasting made with Channel.broadcast_to, you
should use Channel.broadcasting_for to generate an underlying stream name:

```ruby
# app/jobs/chat_relay_job.rb
class ChatRelayJob < ApplicationJob
  def perform(room, message)
    ChatChannel.broadcast_to room, text: message
  end
end
```

```ruby
# test/jobs/chat_relay_job_test.rb
require "test_helper"

class ChatRelayJobTest < ActiveJob::TestCase
  include ActionCable::TestHelper

  test "broadcast message to room" do
    room = rooms(:all)

    assert_broadcast_on(ChatChannel.broadcasting_for(room), text: "Hi!") do
      ChatRelayJob.perform_now(room, "Hi!")
    end
  end
end
```

## 14. Running tests in Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where changes are
frequently integrated into the main codebase, and as such, are automatically
tested before merge.

To run all tests in a CI environment, there's just one command you need:

```bash
bin/rails test
```

If you are using System Tests, bin/rails test will not run
them, since they can be slow. To also run them, add another CI step that runs
bin/rails test:system, or change your first step to bin/rails test:all,
which runs all tests including system tests.

## 15. Parallel Testing

Running tests in parallel reduces the time it takes your entire test suite to
run. While forking processes is the default method, threading is supported as
well.

### 15.1. Parallel Testing with Processes

The default parallelization method is to fork processes using Ruby's DRb system.
The processes are forked based on the number of workers provided. The default
number is the actual core count on the machine, but can be changed by the number
passed to the parallelize method.

To enable parallelization add the following to your test_helper.rb:

```ruby
class ActiveSupport::TestCase
  parallelize(workers: 2)
end
```

The number of workers passed is the number of times the process will be forked.
You may want to parallelize your local test suite differently from your CI, so
an environment variable is provided to be able to easily change the number of
workers a test run should use:

```bash
PARALLEL_WORKERS=15 bin/rails test
```

When parallelizing tests, Active Record automatically handles creating a
database and loading the schema into the database for each process. The
databases will be suffixed with the number corresponding to the worker. For
example, if you have 2 workers the tests will create test-database-0 and
test-database-1 respectively.

If the number of workers passed is 1 or fewer the processes will not be forked
and the tests will not be parallelized and they will use the original
test-database database.

Two hooks are provided, one runs when the process is forked, and one runs before
the forked process is closed. These can be useful if your app uses multiple
databases or performs other tasks that depend on the number of workers.

The parallelize_setup method is called right after the processes are forked.
The parallelize_teardown method is called right before the processes are
closed.

```ruby
class ActiveSupport::TestCase
  parallelize_setup do |worker|
    # setup databases
  end

  parallelize_teardown do |worker|
    # cleanup databases
  end

  parallelize(workers: :number_of_processors)
end
```

These methods are not needed or available when using parallel testing with
threads.

### 15.2. Parallel Testing with Threads

If you prefer using threads or are using JRuby, a threaded parallelization
option is provided. The threaded parallelizer is backed by minitest's
Parallel::Executor.

To change the parallelization method to use threads over forks put the following
in your test_helper.rb:

```ruby
class ActiveSupport::TestCase
  parallelize(workers: :number_of_processors, with: :threads)
end
```

Rails applications generated from JRuby or TruffleRuby will automatically
include the with: :threads option.

As in the section above, you can also use the environment variable
PARALLEL_WORKERS in this context, to change the number of workers your test
run should use.

### 15.3. Testing Parallel Transactions

When you want to test code that runs parallel database transactions in threads,
those can block each other because they are already nested under the implicit
test transaction.

To workaround this, you can disable transactions in a test case class by setting
self.use_transactional_tests = false:

```ruby
class WorkerTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  self.use_transactional_tests = false

  test "parallel transactions" do
    # start some threads that create transactions
  end
end
```

With disabled transactional tests, you have to clean up any data tests
create as changes are not automatically rolled back after the test completes.

### 15.4. Threshold to Parallelize tests

Running tests in parallel adds an overhead in terms of database setup and
fixture loading. Because of this, Rails won't parallelize executions that
involve fewer than 50 tests.

You can configure this threshold in your test.rb:

```ruby
config.active_support.test_parallelization_threshold = 100
```

And also when setting up parallelization at the test case level:

```ruby
class ActiveSupport::TestCase
  parallelize threshold: 100
end
```

## 16. Testing Eager Loading

Normally, applications do not eager load in the development or test
environments to speed things up. But they do in the production environment.

If some file in the project cannot be loaded for whatever reason, it is
important to detect it before deploying to production.

### 16.1. Continuous Integration

If your project has CI in place, eager loading in CI is an easy way to ensure
the application eager loads.

CIs typically set an environment variable to indicate the test suite is running
there. For example, it could be CI:

```ruby
# config/environments/test.rb
config.eager_load = ENV["CI"].present?
```

Starting with Rails 7, newly generated applications are configured that way by
default.

If your project does not have continuous integration, you can still eager load
in the test suite by calling Rails.application.eager_load!:

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class ZeitwerkComplianceTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  test "eager loads all files without errors" do
    assert_nothing_raised { Rails.application.eager_load! }
  end
end
```

## 17. Additional Testing Resources

### 17.1. Errors

In system tests, integration tests and functional controller tests, Rails will
attempt to rescue from errors raised and respond with HTML error pages by
default. This behavior can be controlled by the
config.action_dispatch.show_exceptions
configuration.

### 17.2. Testing Time-Dependent Code

Rails provides built-in helper methods that enable you to assert that your
time-sensitive code works as expected.

The following example uses the travel_to helper:

```ruby
# Given a user is eligible for gifting a month after they register.
user = User.create(name: "Gaurish", activation_date: Date.new(2004, 10, 24))
assert_not user.applicable_for_gifting?

travel_to Date.new(2004, 11, 24) do
  # Inside the `travel_to` block `Date.current` is stubbed
  assert_equal Date.new(2004, 10, 24), user.activation_date
  assert user.applicable_for_gifting?
end

# The change was visible only inside the `travel_to` block.
assert_equal Date.new(2004, 10, 24), user.activation_date
```

Please see ActiveSupport::Testing::TimeHelpers API
reference for more information about the available time helpers.

# Chapters

This guide introduces techniques for debugging Ruby on Rails applications.

After reading this guide, you will know:

- The purpose of debugging.

- How to track down problems and issues in your application that your tests aren't identifying.

- The different ways of debugging.

- How to analyze the stack trace.

## 1. View Helpers for Debugging

One common task is to inspect the contents of a variable. Rails provides three different ways to do this:

- debug

- to_yaml

- inspect

### 1.1. debug

The debug helper will return a <pre> tag that renders the object using the YAML format. This will generate human-readable data from any object. For example, if you have this code in a view:

```ruby
<%= debug @article %>
<p>
  <b>Title:</b>
  <%= @article.title %>
</p>
```

You'll see something like this:

```yaml
--- !ruby/object Article
attributes:
  updated_at: 2008-09-05 22:55:47
  body: It's a very helpful guide for debugging your Rails app.
  title: Rails debugging guide
  published: t
  id: "1"
  created_at: 2008-09-05 22:55:47
attributes_cache: {}


Title: Rails debugging guide
```

### 1.2. to_yaml

Alternatively, calling to_yaml on any object converts it to YAML. You can pass this converted object into the simple_format helper method to format the output. This is how debug does its magic.

```ruby
<%= simple_format @article.to_yaml %>
<p>
  <b>Title:</b>
  <%= @article.title %>
</p>
```

The above code will render something like this:

```yaml
--- !ruby/object Article
attributes:
updated_at: 2008-09-05 22:55:47
body: It's a very helpful guide for debugging your Rails app.
title: Rails debugging guide
published: t
id: "1"
created_at: 2008-09-05 22:55:47
attributes_cache: {}

Title: Rails debugging guide
```

### 1.3. inspect

Another useful method for displaying object values is inspect, especially when working with arrays or hashes. This will print the object value as a string. For example:

```ruby
<%= [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].inspect %>
<p>
  <b>Title:</b>
  <%= @article.title %>
</p>
```

Will render:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Title: Rails debugging guide
```

## 2. The Logger

It can also be useful to save information to log files at runtime. Rails maintains a separate log file for each runtime environment.

### 2.1. What is the Logger?

Rails makes use of the ActiveSupport::Logger class to write log information. Other loggers, such as Log4r, may be substituted:

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb
config.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
config.logger = Log4r::Logger.new("Application Log")
```

By default, each log is created under Rails.root/log/ and the log file is named after the environment in which the application is running.

### 2.2. Log Levels

When something is logged, it's printed into the corresponding log if the log
level of the message is equal to or higher than the configured log level. If you
want to know the current log level, you can call the Rails.logger.level
method.

The available log levels are: :debug, :info, :warn, :error, :fatal,
and :unknown, corresponding to the log level numbers from 0 up to 5,
respectively. To change the default log level:

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb
config.log_level = :warn
```

This is useful when you want to log under development or staging without flooding your production log with unnecessary information.

The default Rails log level is :debug. However, it is set to :info for the production environment in the default generated config/environments/production.rb.

### 2.3. Sending Messages

To write in the current log use the logger.(debug|info|warn|error|fatal|unknown) method from within a controller, model, or mailer:

```ruby
logger.debug "Person attributes hash: #{@person.attributes.inspect}"
logger.info "Processing the request..."
logger.fatal "Terminating application, raised unrecoverable error!!!"
```

Here's an example of a method instrumented with extra logging:

```ruby
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  # ...

  def create
    @article = Article.new(article_params)
    logger.debug "New article: #{@article.attributes.inspect}"
    logger.debug "Article should be valid: #{@article.valid?}"

    if @article.save
      logger.debug "The article was saved and now the user is going to be redirected..."
      redirect_to @article, notice: 'Article was successfully created.'
    else
      render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  # ...

  private
    def article_params
      params.expect(article: [:title, :body, :published])
    end
end
```

Here's an example of the log generated when this controller action is executed:

```
Started POST "/articles" for 127.0.0.1 at 2018-10-18 20:09:23 -0400
Processing by ArticlesController#create as HTML
  Parameters: {"utf8"=>"✓", "authenticity_token"=>"XLveDrKzF1SwaiNRPTaMtkrsTzedtebPPkmxEFIU0ordLjICSnXsSNfrdMa4ccyBjuGwnnEiQhEoMN6H1Gtz3A==", "article"=>{"title"=>"Debugging Rails", "body"=>"I'm learning how to print in logs.", "published"=>"0"}, "commit"=>"Create Article"}

   (0.0ms)  begin transaction
  ↳ app/controllers/articles_controller.rb:31
  Article Create (0.5ms)  INSERT INTO "articles" ("title", "body", "published", "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)  [["title", "Debugging Rails"], ["body", "I'm learning how to print in logs."], ["published", 0], ["created_at", "2018-10-19 00:09:23.216549"], ["updated_at", "2018-10-19 00:09:23.216549"]]
  ↳ app/controllers/articles_controller.rb:31
   (2.3ms)  commit transaction
  ↳ app/controllers/articles_controller.rb:31
The article was saved and now the user is going to be redirected...
Redirected to http://localhost:3000/articles/1
Completed 302 Found in 4ms (ActiveRecord: 0.8ms)
```

Adding extra logging like this makes it easy to search for unexpected or unusual behavior in your logs. If you add extra logging, be sure to make sensible use of log levels to avoid filling your production logs with useless trivia.

### 2.4. Verbose Query Logs

When looking at database query output in logs, it may not be immediately clear why multiple database queries are triggered when a single method is called:

```
irb(main):001:0> Article.pamplemousse
  Article Load (0.4ms)  SELECT "articles".* FROM "articles"
  Comment Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "comments".* FROM "comments" WHERE "comments"."article_id" = ?  [["article_id", 1]]
  Comment Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "comments".* FROM "comments" WHERE "comments"."article_id" = ?  [["article_id", 2]]
  Comment Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "comments".* FROM "comments" WHERE "comments"."article_id" = ?  [["article_id", 3]]
=> #<Comment id: 2, author: "1", body: "Well, actually...", article_id: 1, created_at: "2018-10-19 00:56:10", updated_at: "2018-10-19 00:56:10">
```

After enabling verbose_query_logs we can see additional information for each query:

```
irb(main):003:0> Article.pamplemousse
  Article Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "articles".* FROM "articles"
  ↳ app/models/article.rb:5
  Comment Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "comments".* FROM "comments" WHERE "comments"."article_id" = ?  [["article_id", 1]]
  ↳ app/models/article.rb:6
  Comment Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "comments".* FROM "comments" WHERE "comments"."article_id" = ?  [["article_id", 2]]
  ↳ app/models/article.rb:6
  Comment Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "comments".* FROM "comments" WHERE "comments"."article_id" = ?  [["article_id", 3]]
  ↳ app/models/article.rb:6
=> #<Comment id: 2, author: "1", body: "Well, actually...", article_id: 1, created_at: "2018-10-19 00:56:10", updated_at: "2018-10-19 00:56:10">
```

Below each database statement you can see arrows pointing to the specific source filename (and line number) of the method that resulted in a database call e.g. ↳ app/models/article.rb:5.

This can help you identify and address performance problems caused by N+1 queries: i.e. single database queries that generate multiple additional queries.

Verbose query logs are enabled by default in the development environment logs.

We recommend against using this setting in production environments. It relies on Ruby's Kernel#caller method which tends to allocate a lot of memory in order to generate stacktraces of method calls. Use query log tags (see below) instead.

### 2.5. Verbose Enqueue Logs

Similar to the "Verbose Query Logs" above, allows to print source locations of methods that enqueue background jobs.

Verbose enqueue logs are enabled by default in the development environment logs.

```ruby
# config/environments/development.rb
config.active_job.verbose_enqueue_logs = true
```

```
# bin/rails console
ActiveJob.verbose_enqueue_logs = true
```

We recommend against using this setting in production environments.

### 2.6. Verbose redirect logs

Similar to other verbose log settings above, this logs the source location of a redirect.

```
Redirected to http://localhost:3000/posts/1
↳ app/controllers/posts_controller.rb:32:in `block (2 levels) in create'
```

It is enabled by default in development. To enable in other environments, use this configuration:

```
config.action_dispatch.verbose_redirect_logs = true
```

As with other verbose loggers, it is not recommended to be used in production environments.

## 3. SQL Query Comments

SQL statements can be commented with tags containing runtime information, such as the name of the controller or job, to
trace troublesome queries back to the area of the application that generated these statements. This is useful when you are
logging slow queries (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL),
viewing currently running queries, or for end-to-end tracing tools.

```ruby
config.active_record.query_log_tags_enabled = true
```

Enabling Query tags automatically disables prepared statements, because it makes most queries unique.

By default the name of the application, the name and action of the controller, or the name of the job are logged. The
default format is SQLCommenter. For example:

```
Article Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "articles".* FROM "articles" /*application='Blog',controller='articles',action='index'*/

Article Update (0.3ms)  UPDATE "articles" SET "title" = ?, "updated_at" = ? WHERE "posts"."id" = ? /*application='Blog',job='ImproveTitleJob'*/  [["title", "Improved Rails debugging guide"], ["updated_at", "2022-10-16 20:25:40.091371"], ["id", 1]]
```

The behavior of ActiveRecord::QueryLogs can be
modified to include anything that helps connect the dots from the SQL query, such as request and job ids for
application logs, account and tenant identifiers, etc.

### 3.1. Tagged Logging

When running multi-user, multi-account applications, it's often useful
to be able to filter the logs using some custom rules. TaggedLogging
in Active Support helps you do exactly that by stamping log lines with subdomains, request ids, and anything else to aid debugging such applications.

```ruby
logger = ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging.new(Logger.new(STDOUT))
logger.tagged("BCX") { logger.info "Stuff" }                            # Logs "[BCX] Stuff"
logger.tagged("BCX", "Jason") { logger.info "Stuff" }                   # Logs "[BCX] [Jason] Stuff"
logger.tagged("BCX") { logger.tagged("Jason") { logger.info "Stuff" } } # Logs "[BCX] [Jason] Stuff"
```

### 3.2. Impact of Logs on Performance

Logging will always have a small impact on the performance of your Rails app,
particularly when logging to disk. Additionally, there are a few subtleties:

Using the :debug level will have a greater performance penalty than :fatal,
as a far greater number of strings are being evaluated and written to the
log output (e.g. disk).

Another potential pitfall is too many calls to Logger in your code:

```ruby
logger.debug "Person attributes hash: #{@person.attributes.inspect}"
```

In the above example, there will be a performance impact even if the allowed
output level doesn't include debug. The reason is that Ruby has to evaluate
these strings, which includes instantiating the somewhat heavy String object
and interpolating the variables.

Therefore, it's recommended to pass blocks to the logger methods, as these are
only evaluated if the output level is the same as — or included in — the allowed level
(i.e. lazy loading). The same code rewritten would be:

```ruby
logger.debug { "Person attributes hash: #{@person.attributes.inspect}" }
```

The contents of the block, and therefore the string interpolation, are only
evaluated if debug is enabled. This performance savings are only really
noticeable with large amounts of logging, but it's a good practice to employ.

## 4. Debugging with the debug Gem

When your code is behaving in unexpected ways, you can try printing to logs or
the console to diagnose the problem. Unfortunately, there are times when this
sort of error tracking is not effective in finding the root cause of a problem.
When you actually need to journey into your running source code, the debugger
is your best companion.

The debugger can also help you if you want to learn about the Rails source code
but don't know where to start. Just debug any request to your application and
use this guide to learn how to move from the code you have written into the
underlying Rails code.

Rails 7 includes the debug gem in the Gemfile of new applications generated
by CRuby. By default, it is ready in the development and test environments.
Please check its documentation for usage.

### 4.1. Entering a Debugging Session

By default, a debugging session will start after the debug library is required, which happens when your app boots. But don't worry, the session won't interfere with your application.

To enter the debugging session, you can use binding.break and its aliases: binding.b and debugger. The following examples will use debugger:

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_post, only: %i[ show edit update destroy ]

  # GET /posts or /posts.json
  def index
    @posts = Post.all
    debugger
  end
  # ...
end
```

Once your app evaluates the debugging statement, it'll enter the debugging session:

```ruby
Processing by PostsController#index as HTML
[2, 11] in ~/projects/rails-guide-example/app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
     2|   before_action :set_post, only: %i[ show edit update destroy ]
     3|
     4|   # GET /posts or /posts.json
     5|   def index
     6|     @posts = Post.all
=>   7|     debugger
     8|   end
     9|
    10|   # GET /posts/1 or /posts/1.json
    11|   def show
=>#0    PostsController#index at ~/projects/rails-guide-example/app/controllers/posts_controller.rb:7
  #1    ActionController::BasicImplicitRender#send_action(method="index", args=[]) at ~/.rbenv/versions/3.0.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/gems/actionpack-8.1.0.alpha/lib/action_controller/metal/basic_implicit_render.rb:6
  # and 72 frames (use `bt' command for all frames)
(rdbg)
```

You can exit the debugging session at any time and continue your application execution with the continue (or c) command. Or, to exit both the debugging session and your application, use the quit (or q) command.

### 4.2. The Context

After entering the debugging session, you can type in Ruby code as if you are in a Rails console or IRB.

```ruby
(rdbg) @posts    # ruby
[]
(rdbg) self
#<PostsController:0x0000000000aeb0>
(rdbg)
```

You can also use the p or pp command to evaluate Ruby expressions, which is useful when a variable name conflicts with a debugger command.

```ruby
(rdbg) p headers    # command
=> {"X-Frame-Options"=>"SAMEORIGIN", "X-XSS-Protection"=>"1; mode=block", "X-Content-Type-Options"=>"nosniff", "X-Download-Options"=>"noopen", "X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies"=>"none", "Referrer-Policy"=>"strict-origin-when-cross-origin"}
(rdbg) pp headers    # command
{"X-Frame-Options"=>"SAMEORIGIN",
 "X-XSS-Protection"=>"1; mode=block",
 "X-Content-Type-Options"=>"nosniff",
 "X-Download-Options"=>"noopen",
 "X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies"=>"none",
 "Referrer-Policy"=>"strict-origin-when-cross-origin"}
(rdbg)
```

Besides direct evaluation, the debugger also helps you collect a rich amount of information through different commands, such as:

- info (or i) - Information about current frame.

- backtrace (or bt) - Backtrace (with additional information).

- outline (or o, ls) - Available methods, constants, local variables, and instance variables in the current scope.

#### 4.2.1. The info Command

info provides an overview of the values of local and instance variables that are visible from the current frame.

```ruby
(rdbg) info    # command
%self = #<PostsController:0x0000000000af78>
@_action_has_layout = true
@_action_name = "index"
@_config = {}
@_lookup_context = #<ActionView::LookupContext:0x00007fd91a037e38 @details_key=nil, @digest_cache=...
@_request = #<ActionDispatch::Request GET "http://localhost:3000/posts" for 127.0.0.1>
@_response = #<ActionDispatch::Response:0x00007fd91a03ea08 @mon_data=#<Monitor:0x00007fd91a03e8c8>...
@_response_body = nil
@_routes = nil
@marked_for_same_origin_verification = true
@posts = []
@rendered_format = nil
```

#### 4.2.2. The backtrace Command

When used without any options, backtrace lists all the frames on the stack:

```ruby
=>#0    PostsController#index at ~/projects/rails-guide-example/app/controllers/posts_controller.rb:7
  #1    ActionController::BasicImplicitRender#send_action(method="index", args=[]) at ~/.rbenv/versions/3.0.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/gems/actionpack-2.0.alpha/lib/action_controller/metal/basic_implicit_render.rb:6
  #2    AbstractController::Base#process_action(method_name="index", args=[]) at ~/.rbenv/versions/3.0.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/gems/actionpack-8.1.0.alpha/lib/abstract_controller/base.rb:214
  #3    ActionController::Rendering#process_action(#arg_rest=nil) at ~/.rbenv/versions/3.0.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/gems/actionpack-8.1.0.alpha/lib/action_controller/metal/rendering.rb:53
  #4    block in process_action at ~/.rbenv/versions/3.0.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/gems/actionpack-8.1.0.alpha/lib/abstract_controller/callbacks.rb:221
  #5    block in run_callbacks at ~/.rbenv/versions/3.0.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/gems/activesupport-8.1.0.alpha/lib/active_support/callbacks.rb:118
  #6    ActionText::Rendering::ClassMethods#with_renderer(renderer=#<PostsController:0x0000000000af78>) at ~/.rbenv/versions/3.0.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/gems/actiontext-8.1.0.alpha/lib/action_text/rendering.rb:20
  #7    block {|controller=#<PostsController:0x0000000000af78>, action=#<Proc:0x00007fd91985f1c0 /Users/st0012/...|} in <class:Engine> (4 levels) at ~/.rbenv/versions/3.0.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/gems/actiontext-8.1.0.alpha/lib/action_text/engine.rb:69
  #8    [C] BasicObject#instance_exec at ~/.rbenv/versions/3.0.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/gems/activesupport-8.1.0.alpha/lib/active_support/callbacks.rb:127
  ..... and more
```

Every frame comes with:

- Frame identifier

- Call location

- Additional information (e.g. block or method arguments)

This will give you a great sense about what is happening in your app. However, you probably will notice that:

- There are too many frames (usually 50+ in a Rails app).

- Most of the frames are from Rails or other libraries you use.

The backtrace command provides 2 options to help you filter frames:

- backtrace [num] - only show num numbers of frames, e.g. backtrace 10 .

- backtrace /pattern/ - only show frames with identifier or location that matches the pattern, e.g. backtrace /MyModel/.

It is also possible to use these options together: backtrace [num] /pattern/.

#### 4.2.3. The outline Command

outline is similar to pry and irb's ls command. It will show you what is accessible from the current scope, including:

- Local variables

- Instance variables

- Class variables

- Methods & their sources

```ruby
ActiveSupport::Configurable#methods: config
AbstractController::Base#methods:
  action_methods  action_name  action_name=  available_action?  controller_path  inspect
  response_body
ActionController::Metal#methods:
  content_type       content_type=  controller_name  dispatch          headers
  location           location=      media_type       middleware_stack  middleware_stack=
  middleware_stack?  performed?     request          request=          reset_session
  response           response=      response_body=   response_code     session
  set_request!       set_response!  status           status=           to_a
ActionView::ViewPaths#methods:
  _prefixes  any_templates?  append_view_path   details_for_lookup  formats     formats=  locale
  locale=    lookup_context  prepend_view_path  template_exists?    view_paths
AbstractController::Rendering#methods: view_assigns

# .....

PostsController#methods: create  destroy  edit  index  new  show  update
instance variables:
  @_action_has_layout  @_action_name    @_config  @_lookup_context                      @_request
  @_response           @_response_body  @_routes  @marked_for_same_origin_verification  @posts
  @rendered_format
class variables: @@raise_on_open_redirects
```

### 4.3. Breakpoints

There are many ways to insert and trigger a breakpoint in the debugger. In addition to adding debugging statements (e.g. debugger) directly in your code, you can also insert breakpoints with commands:

- break (or b)

break - list all breakpoints
break <num> - set a breakpoint on the num line of the current file
break <file:num> - set a breakpoint on the num line of file
break <Class#method> or break <Class.method> - set a breakpoint on Class#method or Class.method
break <expr>.<method> - sets a breakpoint on <expr> result's <method> method.

- catch <Exception> - set a breakpoint that'll stop when Exception is raised

- watch <@ivar> - set a breakpoint that'll stop when the result of current object's @ivar is changed (this is slow)

- break - list all breakpoints

- break <num> - set a breakpoint on the num line of the current file

- break <file:num> - set a breakpoint on the num line of file

- break <Class#method> or break <Class.method> - set a breakpoint on Class#method or Class.method

- break <expr>.<method> - sets a breakpoint on <expr> result's <method> method.

And to remove them, you can use:

- delete (or del)

delete - delete all breakpoints
delete <num> - delete the breakpoint with id num

- delete - delete all breakpoints

- delete <num> - delete the breakpoint with id num

#### 4.3.1. The break Command

Set a breakpoint on a specified line number - e.g. b 28

```ruby

#### 4.3.2. The catch Command

Stop when an exception is raised - e.g. catch ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid.

```ruby

#### 4.3.3. The watch Command

Stop when the instance variable is changed - e.g. watch @_response_body.

```ruby

    20|   end
    21|

(rdbg)
```

#### 4.3.4. Breakpoint Options

In addition to different types of breakpoints, you can also specify options to achieve more advanced debugging workflows. Currently, the debugger supports 4 options:

- do: <cmd or expr> - when the breakpoint is triggered, execute the given command/expression and continue the program:

break Foo#bar do: bt - when Foo#bar is called, print the stack frames.

- pre: <cmd or expr> - when the breakpoint is triggered, execute the given command/expression before stopping:

break Foo#bar pre: info - when Foo#bar is called, print its surrounding variables before stopping.

- if: <expr> - the breakpoint only stops if the result of <expr> is true:

break Post#save if: params[:debug] - stops at Post#save if params[:debug] is also true.

- path: <path_regexp> - the breakpoint only stops if the event that triggers it (e.g. a method call) happens from the given path:

break Post#save path: app/services/a_service - stops at Post#save if the method call happens at a path that includes app/services/a_service.

- break Foo#bar do: bt - when Foo#bar is called, print the stack frames.

- break Foo#bar pre: info - when Foo#bar is called, print its surrounding variables before stopping.

- break Post#save if: params[:debug] - stops at Post#save if params[:debug] is also true.

- break Post#save path: app/services/a_service - stops at Post#save if the method call happens at a path that includes app/services/a_service.

Please also note that the first 3 options: do:, pre: and if: are also available for the debug statements we mentioned earlier. For example:

```ruby
[2, 11] in ~/projects/rails-guide-example/app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
     2|   before_action :set_post, only: %i[ show edit update destroy ]
     3|
     4|   # GET /posts or /posts.json
     5|   def index
     6|     @posts = Post.all
=>   7|     debugger(do: "info")
     8|   end
     9|
    10|   # GET /posts/1 or /posts/1.json
    11|   def show
=>#0    PostsController#index at ~/projects/rails-guide-example/app/controllers/posts_controller.rb:7
  #1    ActionController::BasicImplicitRender#send_action(method="index", args=[]) at ~/.rbenv/versions/3.0.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/gems/actionpack-7.0.0.alpha2/lib/action_controller/metal/basic_implicit_render.rb:6
  # and 72 frames (use `bt' command for all frames)
(rdbg:binding.break) info
%self = #<PostsController:0x00000000017480>
@_action_has_layout = true
@_action_name = "index"
@_config = {}
@_lookup_context = #<ActionView::LookupContext:0x00007fce3ad336b8 @details_key=nil, @digest_cache=...
@_request = #<ActionDispatch::Request GET "http://localhost:3000/posts" for 127.0.0.1>
@_response = #<ActionDispatch::Response:0x00007fce3ad397e8 @mon_data=#<Monitor:0x00007fce3ad396a8>...
@_response_body = nil
@_routes = nil
@marked_for_same_origin_verification = true
@posts = #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Post id: 2, title: "qweqwe", content: "qweqwe", created_at: "...
@rendered_format = nil
```

#### 4.3.5. Program Your Debugging Workflow

With those options, you can script your debugging workflow in one line like:

```ruby
def create
  debugger(do: "catch ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid do: bt 10")
  # ...
end
```

And then the debugger will run the scripted command and insert the catch breakpoint

```ruby
(rdbg:binding.break) catch ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid do: bt 10
#0  BP - Catch  "ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid"
[75, 84] in ~/.rbenv/versions/3.0.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/gems/activerecord-7.0.0.alpha2/lib/active_record/validations.rb
    75|     def default_validation_context
    76|       new_record? ? :create : :update
    77|     end
    78|
    79|     def raise_validation_error
=>  80|       raise(RecordInvalid.new(self))
    81|     end
    82|
    83|     def perform_validations(options = {})
    84|       options[:validate] == false || valid?(options[:context])
=>#0    ActiveRecord::Validations#raise_validation_error at ~/.rbenv/versions/3.0.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/gems/activerecord-7.0.0.alpha2/lib/active_record/validations.rb:80
  #1    ActiveRecord::Validations#save!(options={}) at ~/.rbenv/versions/3.0.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/gems/activerecord-7.0.0.alpha2/lib/active_record/validations.rb:53
  # and 88 frames (use `bt' command for all frames)
```

Once the catch breakpoint is triggered, it'll print the stack frames

```ruby
Stop by #0  BP - Catch  "ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid"

(rdbg:catch) bt 10
=>#0    ActiveRecord::Validations#raise_validation_error at ~/.rbenv/versions/3.0.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/gems/activerecord-7.0.0.alpha2/lib/active_record/validations.rb:80
  #1    ActiveRecord::Validations#save!(options={}) at ~/.rbenv/versions/3.0.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/gems/activerecord-7.0.0.alpha2/lib/active_record/validations.rb:53
  #2    block in save! at ~/.rbenv/versions/3.0.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/gems/activerecord-7.0.0.alpha2/lib/active_record/transactions.rb:302
```

This technique can save you from repeated manual input and make the debugging experience smoother.

You can find more commands and configuration options from its documentation.

## 5. Debugging with the web-console Gem

Web Console is a bit like debug, but it runs in the browser. You can request a console in the context of a view or a controller on any page. The console would be rendered next to your HTML content.

### 5.1. Console

Inside any controller action or view, you can invoke the console by
calling the console method.

For example, in a controller:

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def new
    console
    @post = Post.new
  end
end
```

Or in a view:

```ruby
<% console %>

<h2>New Post</h2>
```

This will render a console inside your view. You don't need to care about the
location of the console call; it won't be rendered on the spot of its
invocation but next to your HTML content.

The console executes pure Ruby code: You can define and instantiate
custom classes, create new models, and inspect variables.

Only one console can be rendered per request. Otherwise web-console
will raise an error on the second console invocation.

### 5.2. Inspecting Variables

You can invoke instance_variables to list all the instance variables
available in your context. If you want to list all the local variables, you can
do that with local_variables.

### 5.3. Settings

- config.web_console.allowed_ips: Authorized list of IPv4 or IPv6
addresses and networks (defaults: 127.0.0.1/8, ::1).

- config.web_console.whiny_requests: Log a message when a console rendering
is prevented (defaults: true).

Since web-console evaluates plain Ruby code remotely on the server, don't try
to use it in production.

## 6. Debugging Memory Leaks

A Ruby application (on Rails or not), can leak memory — either in the Ruby code
or at the C code level.

In this section, you will learn how to find and fix such leaks by using tools
such as Valgrind.

### 6.1. Valgrind

Valgrind is an application for detecting C-based memory
leaks and race conditions.

There are Valgrind tools that can automatically detect many memory management
and threading bugs, and profile your programs in detail. For example, if a C
extension in the interpreter calls malloc() but doesn't properly call
free(), this memory won't be available until the app terminates.

For further information on how to install Valgrind and use with Ruby, refer to
Valgrind and Ruby
by Evan Weaver.

### 6.2. Find a Memory Leak

There is an excellent article about detecting and fixing memory leaks at Derailed, which you can read here.

## 7. Plugins for Debugging

There are some Rails plugins to help you to find errors and debug your
application. Here is a list of useful plugins for debugging:

- Query Trace Adds query
origin tracing to your logs.

- Exception Notifier
Provides a mailer object and a default set of templates for sending email
notifications when errors occur in a Rails application.

- Better Errors Replaces the
standard Rails error page with a new one containing more contextual information,
like source code and variable inspection.

- RailsPanel Chrome extension for Rails
development that will end your tailing of development.log. Have all information
about your Rails app requests in the browser — in the Developer Tools panel.
Provides insight to db/rendering/total times, parameter list, rendered views and
more.

- Pry An IRB alternative and runtime developer console.
